### Project README

### Introduction
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for our project aimed at enhancing cybersecurity within the context of a job platform. Our goal is to identify vulnerabilities and implement fixes to bolster the platform's security and protect user data. This README provides an overview of the project, highlighting the key fixes and security enhancements.

### Project Overview
Our project focuses on improving the security of an online job platform. The platform includes various features related to user management, job posting, profile management, and report generation. The project's primary objectives are as follows:
- Identify vulnerabilities within the system.
- Implement practical solutions to address these vulnerabilities.
- Enhance the overall security and integrity of the job platform.

### Vulnerabilities and Fixes
#### 1. Logging and Log Trails
##### Vulnerability:
The system lacked a comprehensive logging mechanism, making it challenging to diagnose issues, monitor security, and ensure compliance with regulations.

##### Fix:
We implemented a robust logging system using the Winston library. The system now logs various events, actions, and errors, ensuring traceability and accountability. Logs are categorized and stored securely.

#### 2. API Rate Limiting
##### Vulnerability:
The system did not have rate limiting, making it susceptible to abuse and DDoS attacks.

##### Fix:
We added rate limiting to the API using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. This restricts the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame, preventing abuse and ensuring fair resource usage.

#### 3. NoSQL Injection Protection
##### Vulnerability:
The system was vulnerable to NoSQL injection attacks due to improper handling of user inputs in database queries.

##### Fix:
We implemented the `mongo-sanitize` middleware to sanitize user inputs, preventing NoSQL injection vulnerabilities. This middleware automatically removes potentially dangerous characters and constructs from incoming requests.

#### 4. Password Hashing with Salt
##### Vulnerability:
The system used unsalted password hashing, making it susceptible to rainbow table attacks.

##### Fix:
We upgraded the password hashing mechanism to use bcrypt with automatically generated salts. This significantly enhances password security and protects against rainbow table attacks.

#### 5. CORS Configuration
##### Vulnerability:
The system lacked proper CORS configuration, exposing it to CSRF attacks, information leakage, and unauthorized data access.

##### Fix:
We added CORS configuration to specify allowed origins. This limits requests to trusted domains, mitigating CSRF attacks and enhancing overall security.

#### 6. CSRF Protection with Synchronizer Token Pattern
##### Vulnerability:
The system was vulnerable to CSRF attacks, allowing attackers to manipulate user sessions and data.

##### Fix:
We implemented the Synchronizer Token Pattern to generate and validate CSRF tokens. This ensures that only requests with valid tokens are accepted, protecting against CSRF attacks.

#### 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
##### Vulnerability:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks can compromise user data, deface websites, and harm an organization's reputation.

##### Fix:
Implement robust XSS protection measures, such as input validation, output encoding, and using security libraries like 'secure-request-encoder'.

#### 8.Lack of XSS Protection
##### Vulnerability:
The web system lacks protection against XSS attacks, exposing it to potential security risks.

##### Fix:
Introduce the 'secure-request-encoder' NPM package to encode unsafe characters in HTTP request bodies, effectively mitigating XSS vulnerabilities.

#### 9.JWT Authentication
##### Vulnerability:
Previously, our system lacked proper authentication mechanisms, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and security breaches.

##### Fix:
We have implemented JWT authentication to enhance the security of our web system. JSON Web Tokens provide a secure and stateless way to authenticate users, making it much more challenging for attackers to compromise user accounts or access unauthorized resources.

#### 10.User Access Control with 'checkPermissions'
###### Introduction:
In our web system, ensuring proper access control is crucial to maintain security and protect sensitive resources. To achieve this, we have introduced a 'checkPermissions' mechanism that allows us to control user access to various parts of the system based on their roles and permissions.

#### 11.Enhancing Error Handling with 'errorHandlerMiddleware'
###### Introduction:
Effective error handling is a crucial aspect of any web system, ensuring that issues are gracefully handled and reported without compromising the system's stability or security. To improve our error handling capabilities, we've introduced the 'errorHandlerMiddleware' into our web system.

#### 12.Insufficient User Authentication
##### Vulnerability:
The web system lacks robust user authentication, potentially compromising user data and system security.

##### Fix:
Enhance user authentication by integrating Google OAuth2, which simplifies logins, improves security, ensures data privacy compliance, and offers a streamlined user experience.

#### 13.CORS Configuration
##### Vulnerability:
The system lacked proper CORS configuration, exposing it to CSRF attacks, information leakage, and unauthorized data access.

##### Fix:
We added CORS configuration to specify allowed origins. This limits requests to trusted domains, mitigating CSRF attacks and enhancing overall security.
